      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "Nice work, Alex! Eight K is solid. How's the knee been holding up? Last time you mentioned some soreness after longer runs.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Actually it's been way better. I've been stretching more and doing yoga twice a week. The physio was right about consistency — it really makes a difference.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "That's great to hear. Consistency with the yoga and stretching sounds like it's paying off. How's everything else going — work, the Spain trip planning?",

      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Work is picking up. The dashboard launch is end of February and the pressure is starting to build. But honestly, I'm making real progress on work-life balance. Left the office by six every day this week.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "Leaving by six consistently is a real achievement, especially with a big launch coming. That's a concrete boundary. What about the Spain trip?",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Jamie and I have been looking at hotels in Barcelona. We're set on June. And between us — I've been thinking about proposing there. Four years together feels right.",

      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Not yet, just the idea. I want to learn enough Spanish to at least say the important parts. My Duolingo streak is at a hundred and forty-two days now, so I'm committed.",

      "speaker": "user",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "Ha! Golden retrievers and shoes — a classic combination. It sounds like things are generally going well. Running, yoga, work boundaries, Spain planning. How are you feeling about the overall balance?",
      "t_ms": 1770021148000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Honestly? Pretty good. Better than last month for sure. The running helps clear my head, the yoga keeps the knee in check, and leaving work on time gives me evenings back. I feel like I'm finally getting a handle on things.",
      "t_ms": 1770021165000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "That's a really positive shift, Alex. You've built some solid routines — running, yoga, work boundaries. Keep that momentum going.",
