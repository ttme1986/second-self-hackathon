    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "Ten K with no knee issues — that's fantastic progress! You're really building up nicely toward the half-marathon. A twelve K tomorrow would be a big step.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Yeah, the training plan says I should be around this distance by now so I'm right on track. Oh — Maya loved the workout gear I sent for her birthday. She texted a bunch of photos of her at the gym wearing it.",

    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Honestly, it's been rough. I stayed past midnight twice this week prepping for the dashboard launch. The VP pulled the timeline forward by two weeks and everyone's scrambling. I told the team it's under control but... I don't know.",
      "t_ms": 1770577268000
    },

      "speaker": "assistant",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "I mean, it is what it is. The launch is important for the company and for my promotion track. Jamie hasn't said anything but I can tell dinner alone two nights bothered them. I missed yoga both times too.",
      "t_ms": 1770577292000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "It sounds like the work pressure is starting to affect other parts of your life — Jamie, your yoga routine. That's worth paying attention to, especially since you'd been making good progress on boundaries.",

    {
      "speaker": "user",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "That sounds lovely! There are some great Italian spots in the city. I can note that as an action — book a restaurant for Jamie's birthday dinner next Friday.",

    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Perfect. Also — Mom called today. She mentioned she's having minor surgery next month. Nothing serious, she says, but she sounded a little worried. I really need to get up to Sacramento before then.",
      "t_ms": 1770577345000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "I hope she'll be okay. Visiting before the surgery would probably mean a lot to her, especially since it's been a while. Want me to flag that as a priority?",
      "t_ms": 1770577350000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Yeah, please. I keep saying I'll go and then something comes up. Oh, one more thing — I've been looking at engagement rings online during lunch breaks. Nothing serious yet, just browsing. The Barcelona proposal is really taking shape in my head.",
      "t_ms": 1770577370000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "That's exciting! The Spain trip is about four months away, so you have time to find something perfect. Your Spanish practice will make the moment even more special.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "user",
      "text": "Duolingo streak is at a hundred and forty-eight now. I'm thinking about booking an italki lesson to practice actual conversation. The app is great but I want to be able to speak naturally.",
      "t_ms": 1770577395000
    },
    {
      "speaker": "assistant",
      "text": "That's a smart next step — real conversation practice would accelerate your progress. You've got a solid foundation with almost five months of daily practice.",

      "speaker": "user",
