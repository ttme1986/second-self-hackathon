# Demo Attachments

Files used during the demo video recording. These are shared as photo attachments during the live Chat conversation to demonstrate **agentic vision** (Gemini 3 Flash + code execution + thinking mode).

## Preparation

### Blood Pressure Reading (`bp-reading.png`)

1. Open `bp-reading.html` in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the monitor display
3. Save as `bp-reading.png`
4. Transfer to the recording device

This image is shared during the Chat section of the demo at timestamp **1:00**. Gemini's agentic vision extracts the reading (142/91), identifies it as Stage 1 hypertension, and connects it to the stress pattern tracked across previous conversations.

## Usage in Demo Script

See `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` section **1:00 – 1:20 | Photo Attachment + Agentic Vision** for exact timing and narration.
